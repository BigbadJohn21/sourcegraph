# Search configuration

## Indexing

<!--
TODO stub doc that will make it more prominently suggested to site admins to enable indexed search. The only reason why they would NOT enable it is that it requires a lot of memory. This is most likely to cause issues when people spin it up to try it on their local dev machine, or a poorly provisioned node. In the future we will do the harder work to notify them of impending memory issues, but for now we'll just explain the risks and suggest turning it on in cases where it would work.
